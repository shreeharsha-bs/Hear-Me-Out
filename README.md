# Hear Me Out: Exploring Conversational AI Through Speech-to-Speech Models

**Hear Me Out** is an exploratory tool for experiencing the paralinguistic and extra-linguistic capabilities of a new wave of conversational AI models. These speech-to-speech models process spoken language directly from audio, without first converting it to text. They promise more natural, expressive, and emotionally aware interactions by retaining prosody, intonation, and other vocal cues throughout the conversation.

In this video, we explore the **Moshi** speech-to-speech model and its responses:

### Example 1: Emotional Awareness

Notice how the model disambiguates between inputs with levity and frustration, correctly reflecting the speaker's emotional state in its responses. This distinction adds a more human-like quality to the interaction.

### Example 2: Voice Conversion

By applying voice transformations, we simulate how the model might respond to different speaker characteristics. While the differences in these responses are more subtle and inconsistent under repetition, hearing oneself in another voice opens up new perspectives.

## Features

**Hear Me Out** enables users to experience interactions with conversational models in ways that aren't typically accessible with regular benchmarking systems. Key features include:

- **Speech-to-Speech Models**: Users can choose from a variety of models that retain vocal cues like prosody and intonation.
- **Real-Time Voice Conversion**: Step into someone else’s voice – literally – and investigate how conversational AI systems interpret and respond to various speaker identities and expressions.
- **Side-by-Side Comparisons**: Ask a question with your own voice, then re-ask using a transformed voice. Compare the AI’s responses to observe differences in tone, phrasing, or behavior.
- **Insights Through Data**: Visualize metrics like speech rate, sentiment analysis, and more. [INSERT GRAPHIC DEMOING SOME STATS ABOUT SPEECH RATE, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ETC.]

Through this immersive experience, we hope users will gain insights into identity, voice, and AI behavior. Ultimately, we aim to surface meaningful questions and inspire future research that promotes fairness and inclusivity with **Hear Me Out**.
